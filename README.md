#### Project Description: 

It is always hard to find pairs to explore restaurants, not only for incoming freshmen who haven't established their own friend group, but also for upperclassmen who want to meet new friends and explore restaurants that they haven’t explored before. The situation worsened after the pandemic as most classes and office hours became hybrid. Our app provides a solution for Columbia students to meet peers that are eagering to hanging out to the same restaurant. 

#### Functionality:


Basic Functions:

User Registration: Ask users to register with their UNI.

User Profile: Allows users to specify their preferences, MBTI, and dietary restrictions.

Restaurant Database: A list of restaurants, their locations and ratings.

Restaurant Filtering: Allows users to filter restaurants based on various criteria such as distance, cuisine style, and ratings.


Main Functions:

Restaurant Subscription: Users can subscribe to specific restaurants, receiving notifications of updates such as new reviews or pairing requests.

Restaurant Review & Rating: Users can share their restaurant experiences by writing reviews and establishing ratings.

Pairing Initiations: Users can initiate dining pairings by selecting a restaurant and specifying the desired time for their visit.


Other Functions:

No-Show Policy: To maintain reliability and fairness, users who repeatedly fail to show up to pairings without prior cancellation (more than 3 times) face account suspension.

Other Filtering Functions: We recognize that users may sometimes prefer to dine out exclusively with a specific user group. We provide the option to choose.


## 2. Hospital Reservation System

#### Functionality:

Patient Interaction: Patients will first register a user account for the reservation system. During this registration process, they will provide personal details such as their name, date of birth, email, pertinent medical history and insurance. Then patients will get their unique patient id. After that, patients can search for doctors based on department, specialty and proceed to schedule appointments according to their preferences. Furthermore, patients can keep track of their appointments, with access to comprehensive details, including the doctor's name, available appointment time, and status. During the payment process, patients are allowed to make payments through the platform linked with their insurance information conveniently.

Doctor Interaction: Doctors are able to visualize their schedules and patient appointments in a dashboard after login. This feature ensures that they remain organized and informed about their clinical commitments. In addition, doctors also have access to comprehensive patient information, including medical records and insurance details, enabling them to provide personalized care.

#### Project Description:

MSA is a safety company, they make PPE for personal and industrial use. One of their PPE systems for warehouses includes a lanyard (attached to the machine) and a harness (worn by the worker). Sometimes this connection gets disconnected, for a variety of reasons, without the worker noticing. We were asked to implement a system using Image Recognition that will overlook the connection and will be able to always provide an indication if the connection is compliant or non-compliant. The company provided us with access to AWS Rekognition software for the model training, we decided on also using Microsoft Azure Custom Vision.

-The main goal was to provide MSA with software that is capable of detecting 2 elements; the harness D-ring and the lanyard hook, and then decide if they are connected properly or not.

-The stretch goal was to provide MSA with a real-world prototype that can showcase this model’s performance and the optimal camera location.
